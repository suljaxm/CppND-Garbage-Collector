# CppND-Garbage-Collector
The final project is to implement my own version of a smart pointer. 


## Compiling
To compile the project, first, create a `build` directory and change to that directory:
```
mkdir build && cd build
```
From within the `build` directory, then run `cmake` and `make` as follows:
```
cmake ..
make
```
## Running
Run the resulting executable: ./garbage_collector
